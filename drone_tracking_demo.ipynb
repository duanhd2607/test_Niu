        "*   **Video Loading Blocked by Placeholder Path**: All attempts to load the drone video failed due to the `video_file_path` variable remaining set to the placeholder `\"/path/to/your/drone_video.mp4\"`. This prevented any actual video frames from being read, which was a critical prerequisite for all subsequent steps.\n",
        "*   **YOLO Model Successfully Initialized**: The YOLOv3-tiny model files (`yolov3-tiny.weights`, `yolov3-tiny.cfg`, `coco.names`) were successfully downloaded and loaded using OpenCV's DNN module. The class names (80 classes) and output layers (`yolo_16`, `yolo_23`) were also correctly identified.\n",
        "*   **YOLO Detection Logic Implemented**: The code for preprocessing video frames into a blob, performing a forward pass through the YOLO network, parsing raw detections (bounding boxes, confidence scores, class IDs), and applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) was fully implemented. However, this logic could not be executed on actual video data due to the video loading failure.\n",
        "*   **CentroidTracker Implemented and Initialized**: A `CentroidTracker` class was fully defined, including methods for registering, deregistering, and updating object centroids based on new detections. An instance of this tracker was successfully initialized, ready to receive detection data.\n",
        "*   **Integrated Tracking Pipeline Ready (Pending Video Input)**: A comprehensive video processing loop, combining YOLO object detection, NMS, and the CentroidTracker update mechanism, was implemented. This pipeline was designed to draw bounding boxes and display tracking IDs on frames, but it remained non-functional due to the lack of a valid video input.\n",

        "*   **User Action Required**: The most critical next step is for the user to replace the placeholder `video_file_path` with an actual, absolute path to their drone video file in the relevant code blocks. Without this, the object detection and tracking pipeline cannot be tested or demonstrated.\n",
        "*   **Review Tracking Parameters**: Once the video is loading, evaluate the performance of the `CentroidTracker`. Adjust parameters like `maxDisappeared` (currently 50 frames) if objects are being lost or re-assigned IDs too frequently or too slowly, to optimize tracking continuity for the specific drone video content.\n"
